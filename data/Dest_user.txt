Rasht:
Rasht is the largest city on Iran's Caspian Sea coast. Due to being between the coast and the mountains, the local environment is rainy with humid subtropical and mediterranean influences. It also has temperate rainforest to its south, contrasting to the mostly arid Iran.


tehran:
Tehran is Iran's administrative, economic, and cultural centre as well as the major industrial and transport centre of the region. The city sits on the slopes of the Elburz Mountains, about 1,173m above sea level, on the northwestern fringes of the Kavir desert.

kish:
Kish is a 91.5 square kilometer (35.3 sq. mi) resort island and it is considered as one of the Persian Gulf islands and tourist sites of Hormozgan Province that is located 18 km (12 mi) from mainland Iran's south shore with the altitude of 30 meters above the sea level in the north range of the Persian Gulf.


kashan:
Kashan is a city in the Isfahan province of Iran. Kashan is the first of the large oases along the Qom-Kerman road which runs along the edge of the central deserts of Iran. Its charm is thus mainly due to the contrast between the parched immensities of the deserts and the greenery of the well-tended oasis.
